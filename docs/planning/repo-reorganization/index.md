## Status

Implementation is in progress.

- TG1 is complete: the shared logging foundation in `workflows/pipelines/shared/logging.py` is now covered by focused tests.
- TG2 has started with a bootstrap slice: `workflows/pyproject.toml` now defines the target-tree project metadata and `workflows/.env.example` now holds the shared environment template.
- TG2 has now started the shared-module move: `config.py` and `deps.py` live under `workflows/pipelines/shared/`, and the first temporary `workflows/comicbook/` compatibility wrappers now exist for those modules.
- The broader TG2 module move, test move, and remaining `comicbook` compatibility-wrapper work are still pending.
